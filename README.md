# INF264 - Introduction to Machine Learning

In this course, we will learn basics of the machine learning. The goal is to give students both theoretical understanding of the basic principles behind machine learning methods and practical skills to apply machine learning methods in real-life problems.

The course will cover the following topics:
- basic concepts in machine learning
- k-nearest neighbor classifier
- linear models for classification and regression
- decision trees
- model selection and evaluation
- support vector machines and kernels
- probabilistic models
- ensemble methods
- neural networks
- machine learning in practice
- dimensionality reduction
- clustering

## Projects
The course includes two projects where we practice implementation and application of machine learning algorithms into real-world data. The project deadlines are 24.9.and 22.10.
Project assignments will be available about three weeks before the deadline. Teaching assistants and group leaders are available to help you.
The projects can be done either alone or in pairs.
The projects are mandatory part of the course and to pass the course you have to pass every project. There is no possibility to resubmit failed projects.

## Exercises
We are going to have two types of weekly exercises: In-class exercises and homework. Initially, there are 7 exercise sessions; Note, however, that several sessions may be cancelled due to low attendance. In these sessions, we will solve problems related to week's lecture topics in small groups (Note that all sessions have identical content).
Homework contains mostly programming exercises. Homework is not compulsory but those who return their solutions will get feedback. You can get help to solving homework in by asking teaching assistants in conjunction of exercise sessions.

## Exam
The course exam will be on 25.11. Please check the exact time and place two weeks before the exam.

## Grading
- Exam 50%
- Projects 50%

To pass the course, you need to get a passing grade both from the exam and EVERY project.
